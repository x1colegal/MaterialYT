/**
 * A thread-safe, DISK-BACKED reassembly buffer for one SABR session. The session thread writes each
 * media segment at its ABSOLUTE byte offset ([writeAt], the segment's startRange) — exactly like the
 * proven Node harness, so the reassembled stream is byte-exact regardless of the order segments arrive
 * in. The reader serves any COVERED region ([readCovered] — not just a prefix: a seek-restarted session
 * (see [SabrAudioStream]) writes a tail region while the head may stay a gap, and reads inside covered
 * regions are always served. Backing is a spool FILE, not a heap array — a multi-hour podcast episode
 * or a 2160p video track must never risk an OutOfMemoryError; the OS page cache keeps hot reads cheap.
 *
 * [expectedLength] is the format's contentLength (known up front from /player). The reader's progress
 * ([lastReadEnd]) feeds [awaitDemand] — the demand-pacing gate a PLAYBACK session waits on so the drain
 * follows what the player consumes instead of pulling the whole track eagerly (proven live: a SABR
 * session keeps serving after minutes-long idle gaps between POSTs).
