/**
 * Pure detection of a SABR stream-protection (attestation) cap, shared by [SabrSession] and
 * [SabrVideoSession]. A client whose poToken cannot satisfy attestation (MWEB / IOS-class) is served a
 * small free window, then the server delivers ONLY `STREAM_PROTECTION_STATUS >= 2` with no media
 * (proven live: `tests/probe-mweb-sabr.mjs`). Counting consecutive no-progress responses under active
 * protection lets a session bail fast with a clear reason instead of grinding to the dry cap, so the
 * roster/stall fallback moves on to a client that can attest. JVM-unit-tested ([SabrProtectionTest]).
