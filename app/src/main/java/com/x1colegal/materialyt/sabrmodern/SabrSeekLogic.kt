/**
 * Pure seek-restart decision shared by [SabrAudioStream] and [SabrVideoStream]. Given the live session's
 * landing anchor and the reader's target byte, it decides whether to let the current demand-paced drain
 * reach the target, wait out a just-started session's landing grace, cold-start a fresh session at an
 * estimated player time, or give up after the restart budget. Fully JVM-unit-tested
 * ([SabrSeekLogicTest]) — no Android, no I/O.
 *
 * Two correctness rules encoded here:
 *  - A session that landed AT OR BEFORE the target ([LetDrain]) must NEVER be restarted: re-issuing the
 *    same linear estimate only cancels the one session making forward progress, so a seek that lands
 *    early by more than a catch-up window used to burn the whole restart budget into a player error.
 *  - An unknown duration yields estimate 0, i.e. a from-0 session, which then lands at/before the target
 *    and drains forward — never an endless restart-at-0 loop.
